#### Source code:
##### Setup:
 - [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
 - [Install nvidia-containers](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
 - In the root of the project, you coud leverage Makefile and it's command `make`:
	 - `make build` build *gfootball* container with GPU support
	 - `make start` start *gfootball* container with GPU support and connected DISPLAY
	 - `make play` run Google football in *gfootball*  container
